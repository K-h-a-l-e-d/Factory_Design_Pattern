# Factory Design Pattern Example in Dart

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of factory design pattern in dart where a factory constructor takes a shape input from an Enum of shapes (Square, Circle, Rectangle) 
then instantiates an object for the corresponding Shape Class which in turn calls "revealMe()" function which is the shape base class function interface that's overidden with a different implementation for each shape based on the shape's specifications
